## Introduction

Hey there! I'm Arnold, but I go by @Aksine in the online world. I like indepth discussion about various topics regarding technology,philosophy and emotions.

I also have always been very fascinated with computers and i believe that i have very broad surface level knowledge in this topic, down from transistors to all the way at the top with complex architecture that spans multiple systems. I'm still trying to fill in the gaps in my knowledge tree of computers and might look to specialize in a direction that would really interest me ,but i'm still trying to search for that interest.

In my spare time ,I really enjoy doing projects on my homelab (i've got a very expansive one that spans a few location ,which is described in more detail in this blogpost).The personal website is another project that itself is built with  whole CI/CD pipeline and is hosted on a k3s cluster in my Australia homelab (more details in this blogpost ).

My other interests include playing videogames and running. For videogames ,these days i mostly play League of Legends these days with few other single player games like CP2077 ,SF6 etc here and there. 

As for running ,it is nothing special , i usually run 5ks three to four times a week and current PB for 5k is 26:31.


## Career

Currently in my IT career , I worked as an IT consultant who dealt with technologies regarding Infrastructure,Security and Networking ,mostly involving VMware,Cisco,Microsoft and a bit of Linux.

I am currently looking to transition to being an DevOps engineer. I am currently self-learning skills like Automation,CI/CD pipelines, Git ,Kubernetes to get ready and trying to master the basics.

I am also familiar with cloud based offerings like AWS,GCP as lot underlying infrastructure concepts are similar (its only really the pricing models that you have to figure in my opinion).

## Computer related stuff

As i mentioned earlier in the career segment , my interests in computer don't stop there . At the top of mind,these are some of following topics that i want to delve deeper into (they may have some significance  in my career).

- Learn all about BGP and how ISPs work with them
- Build Linux from Scratch
- Learn about graphics programming
- Learn about kernel programming
- Learn about assembly programming
- Learn about processor micro-architecture
